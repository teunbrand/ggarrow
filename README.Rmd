The goal of ggarrow is to draw arrows in [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). It is a [{ggplot2} extension](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) package that focusses on specialised geometry layers to expand the toolkit of arrows. While you're reading this, I'll take this opportunity to inform you that while this package probably works, it is not very polished.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggarrow from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("teunbrand/ggarrow")
```

## Arrows

They're made for pointing at things. The workhorse functionality is in the `geom_arrow()` function that, unsurprisingly, draws arrows. Arrows, in contrast to vanilla lines, can have variable widths.

```{r basic_example}
library(ggarrow)

p <- ggplot(whirlpool(5), aes(x, y, colour = group)) +
  coord_equal() +
  guides(colour = "none")
p + geom_arrow(aes(linewidth = I(arc))) # Identity scale for linewidth
```

Besides varying linewidths, there is also an option to place arrows along the path. 
You could draw arbitrarily many of these, but I doubt that will look pretty.

```{r middle_arrows}
p + geom_arrow(arrow_mid = arrow_head_wings(), mid_place = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
```

You can also tweak what the arrows should look like.
The example below is a bit verbose, but gives an impression of the available options by combining different styles of arrow heads and what are termed 'arrow fins'.

```{r, show_ornaments}
p + geom_arrow(aes(arrow_head = group, arrow_fins = group), linewidth = 2) +
  scale_arrow_head_discrete(values = list(
    "head_wings",
    arrow_head_wings(offset = 20, inset = 70),
    arrow_head_line(lineend = "parallel"),
    arrow_head_line(45, lineend = "round"),
    "head_minimal"
  ), guide = "none") +
  scale_arrow_fins_discrete(values = list(
    "fins_feather",
    arrow_fins_feather(indent = 0, outdent = 0, height = 1),
    "fins_line",
    arrow_fins_line(90),
    "fins_minimal"
  ), guide = "none")
```

There are some other geoms that mimic bread-and-butter ggplot2 layers, such as `geom_arrow_segment()` and `geom_arrow_curve()`, that add the same arrow functionality on top of the `geom_segment()` and `geom_curve()` layers.

Aside from these, there is also `geom_arrow_chain()`, which has no equivalent in vanilla ggplot2. It adds arrows in between points, and dodges the endpoints a bit so that they don't seem to touch. In the example below, we can see that we can dodge points of different sizes.

```{r arrow_chain}
t <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 11)
l <- rep(c(1, 0.4), length.out = 11)

df <- data.frame(
  x = cos(t) * l,
  y = sin(t) * l,
  size = l
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y, size = size)) +
  geom_point(colour = 2) +
  geom_arrow_chain() +
  coord_equal()
```

## Dependency statement

The {ggarrow} package largely takes on the same dependencies as {ggplot2} to keep it on the lightweight side. However, this package wouldn't work at all without the {polyclip} dependency, which is the only one outside {ggplot2}'s imports.

## Related work

Of course, the {grid} package, on which {ggplot2} is build upon, offers some options for arrows.
The [{arrowheadr}](https://github.com/wjschne/arrowheadr) package provides some great extensions for arrowheads.
The [{vwlines}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vwline) package that handles variable widths lines much more graciously than this package.
Both the [{gggenes}](https://wilkox.org/gggenes/) and [{gggenomes}](https://thackl.github.io/gggenomes/) packages use arrows in a domain-specific context.
For vector field visualisation, there is the [{ggquiver}](http://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/ggquiver/) package.
The [{ggarchery}](https://github.com/mdhall272/ggarchery) package also provides extended options for the `geom_segment()` parametrisation of lines.
